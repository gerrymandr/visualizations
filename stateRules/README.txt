Interactive visualization tool by Zach Levitt and Ethan Ackerman

This R Shiny App downloads a state boundary file from the R tigris package and merges it with state redistricting data from Google Sheets. 

The state redistricting data can be accessed at this link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YhPhwGKIqbtwPvz6mbHkTj68WJMim2lPmtVrO4cfP4A/edit#gid=0. It must be downloaded as a CSV, the name changed to stateRules.csv, and within a folder called data in the home directory of the R Shiny App.
