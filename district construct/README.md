The district_construct.py file contains the code for importing, manipulating, and exporting the maps of districting plans. To use, download the Sample_Data and key.csv file (or download/concoct your own), run district_construct.py, then run “DistrictConstruct(df_cells,6,starter='key.csv’)” through the console.

The program gives option for count of districts to manage, the possibility to import/export plans, and to adjust the score being used to judge districts on the map (the current default is Polsby-Popper, but Convex-Hull can be substituted via a class argument “measure=‘ch’”). A lasso-select tool is also available for velocity. Compactness scores must be manually updated (by pressing its button) so that computation does not impede on large mapping changes.
