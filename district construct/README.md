The districtr.py file contains the code for importing, manipulating, and exporting the maps of districting plans in any Python IDE. To use, download the Sample_Data and key.csv file (or download/concoct your own), run districtr.py, then run “Districtr(df_cells,6,starter='key.csv’)” through the console.

The program gives option for count of districts to manage, the possibility to import/export plans, and to adjust the score being used to judge districts on the map (the current default is Polsby-Popper, but Convex-Hull can be substituted via a class argument “measure=‘ch’”). A lasso-select tool is also available for velocity. Compactness scores must be manually updated (by pressing its button) so that computation does not impede on large mapping changes.

Districtr itself exists in its most recent/advanced phase as an online tool primarily managed by Anna. It functions much like the Python implementation, but is aiming to be more accessible. We are in the process of cultivating a database to build-in to the online tool, so Shapefiles don't need to be downloaded for new users. Work is still being done on fusing features with ising metrics.
